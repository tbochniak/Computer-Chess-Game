# Computational Chess-Java-OOP-GUI

Introduction:
Computational chess is the field of computer science that involves the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to play and analyze chess. Chess is a complex game that involves strategic thinking, pattern recognition, and decision making, which makes it an ideal domain for testing and improving the capabilities of machine learning algorithms.

Methodology:
In this project, the minimax search algorithm is implemented to predict the best possible move based on the current state of the game. The minimax algorithm works by analyzing and simulating the possible moves and outcomes of a chess game. It evaluates the best possible move for the current player, while also considering the potential moves and counter-moves of the opponent.

Results:
The implementation of the minimax algorithm in this project demonstrates its effectiveness in predicting the best possible move in a chess game. The algorithm can search the game tree up to 5 moves ahead before deciding which is the best move, providing a challenging and interesting game.
